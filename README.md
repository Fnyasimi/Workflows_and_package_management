# Workflows and Package Management

Reproducibility and package management techniques: workflow languages (CWL, Snakemake, and Conda). This course introduces some of the approaches for package management and how to create reproducible workflows or pipelines. 

### Competencies 

This session seeks to impart the following competencies:

1. Knowledge and skills: Bioinformatics tools and their usage.
2. Knowledge and Skills: Command line and scripting based computing skills appropriate to the discipline.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, and the projects that follow, the learner should be able to:

1. Select the best workflow and package managers based on the task at hand
2. Implement a genomic pipeline in at least one workflow manager
3. Set up a reproducible analysis environment

## Outline

- Introduce the high-level concept of workflows and high throughput data analysis
- Hands-on activities for setting up the packages
- Introduce package management and how we can use conda to increase reproducibility with workflows
- Introduce the theory of workflows: with emphasis on one language (say, snakemake)
- Hands-on activities of developing workflows

## Tutorials

1. [Package Management with conda](miniconda_tutorial.md)
2. [Workflow with Snakemake](snakemake_tutorial.md) will provide a quick introduction then we'll dive deeper using [Reproducible Research](https://reproducibility.sschmeier.com/index.html) tutorial.See [this](https://www.biostars.org/p/335903/) tutorial also.
3. [Common Workflow language](nextflow_tutorial.md) tutorial. We will not cover this, but we provide links to useful tutorials for you to explore and learn further. Also see [this](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/01-introduction/index.html) and this(https://andrewjesaitis.com/2017/02/common-workflow-language---a-tutorial-on-making-bioinformatics-repeatable/) walkthroughs.
